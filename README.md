This program is a simple calculator built in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, power and division. The program has been collaboratively developed by different users on Git, making it a great example of a collaborative software development project.

The program is designed to import the necessary functions from separate files, making it easy to add, remove, or modify functions as needed. Each user can contribute their own functions to the project and collaborate with others to refine and improve the code.

The calculator prompts the user to select an operation and input two numbers, and then performs the selected operation using the appropriate function imported from the respective file. The program also includes error handling for division by zero.

This calculator program is a great example of how different users can come together to collaborate on a software development project and create a useful tool for others to use.
